My name is Danny Varner. I'm a programmer who enjoys reading clean code and sometimes being able to write it myself. When not coding, I'm looking to find ways to optimize the value produced in teams through continuous delivery, obsessing over knowing the user, and applying the latest flavor of agile practices.  I work near home in Portland, Oregon for the IoT Data Platform team at Silver Spring Networks with a great group of people.  This blog and all of its content and opinions are my own.

If you want to contact me, I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dannyvarner) or send an email to [danny@dannyvarner.com](danny@dannyvarner.com).
